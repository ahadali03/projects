# Sudoku Solver

A simple Python script that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To use the solver, simply modify the `grid` variable in the script to represent the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve. Then, run the script using a Python interpreter.

The solved puzzle will be printed to the console.


## Notes

- This script is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles that are represented as a 9x9 grid, with each cell containing a single integer value between 0 and 9.
- The `solve` function uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution for the puzzle. 
If the puzzle does not have a unique solution or has no solution at all, the function will return `False`.
